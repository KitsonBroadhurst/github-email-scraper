# Github Email Scraper 
<p>
Used to scrape email addresses from Github user profiles, based on location-based profile search queries. 
E.g. below:
https://github.com/search?q=location%3ABuffalo%2CNY+location%3ASyracuse%2CNY+location%3ARochester%2CNY+location%3AAlbany%2CNY+location%3ABinghamton%2CNY+location%3AIthaca%2CNY&type=Users&s=followers
<p>
I.e., a good excuse to learn how to build a Web scraper with Ruby
